#mxnet-seq2seq

This project implements the sequence to sequence learning with mxnet for open-domain chatbot

## Sequence to Sequence learning with LSTM encoder-decoder

The seq2seq encoder-decoder architecture is introduced by [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks (seq2seq)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215)
 
This implementation borrow idea from lstm_bucketing, I modified it and reconstructed the embedding layer.

## How to run

```
python seq2seq.py
```

## More details coming soon
